## System Architecture

### Architecture Overview

The application will be using client-server architecture. The server will handle API requests and interact with external API, while the client will provide a user interface for interaction.

### Client-Side

- **Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Library**: React

### Server-Side

- **Technologies**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Proxy Server**: Express.js to handle API requests and secure the TMDBI API key.
- **Environment Management**: Use environment variable to store API key.

### Interaction Flow

### 1. Client Request:

-   The client sends a request to the server for data (e.g., search results, movie information).
-   The client receives the data and renders it in their browser (e.g., display movie thumbnails, search results).

### 2. API Gateway Server

-   The server calls out to TMDB with an embeded API key (request).
-   Gets the response from TMDB.
-   Server then sends the response back to the client.
